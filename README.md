# ForgeJam 2022
> **WHAM THE JAM!**

For those who do not already know, a modding jam is an event that happens occasionally in the Modded Minecraft community.
The goal is to create a mod in a restricted time window, with a restricted theme and with specific judging criteria.

ForgeJam is a modding jam hosted by Minecraft Forge. Participants were given the month of July 2022 to create a mod with a 
specific theme: **Item Transportation**. That means transporting item (individually or in bulk) across the world, over
land, sea, or air.

---

This is a **monorepo** of all submissions to the ForgeJam 2022, provided in part as a convenience to cloning all repositories
individually. All submission repositories were forked to the organization soon after the submission deadlines closed, to preserve
their contents until judging finishes.

> After ForgeJam22, these repositories will be archived to preserve their state as of submission, while allowing authors to
> continue development on their original repository. For concerns, please contact @TheCurle and the Forge Team.

## Judging Criteria

Submitted mods will be judged based on five main criteria:

- **Creativity**: how unique the idea of the mod is (whether it has not been seen before, or in other submitted mods)
- **Effectiveness**: how well the mod works at transporting items
- **Theming**: how well the mod sticks to the theme of Minecraft (or itself, should your mod focus around steam-punk airships or something)

There are two “bonus points” categories:

- **Performance**: how well optimised your mod is, and whether it greatly affects frametimes or tick times.
- **Compatibility**: whether your mod works in large packs, has mod integrations, and doesn’t use things like coremods or Mixins.

Of course, this is the first Forge Jam and we’re going to have some fun with it while we’re finding our footing, 
so each of the judges will have their own criteria (and some of them may not be what you expect).

Judging will be done both by the Forge Team and the community. The community's votes will account for 1/3 of all votes in the jam.
